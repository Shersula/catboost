# Notice to external contributors

## Common

CatBoost is a free and open project and we appreciate to receive contributions from our community.

## Contributing code changes

If you would like to contribute a new feature or a bug fix, please discuss your idea first in the GitHub issue.
If there is no issue for your idea, please open one. It may be that somebody is already working on it,
or that there are some complex obstacles that you should know about before starting the implementation.
Usually there are several ways to fix a problem and it is important to find the right approach before spending time on a PR
that cannot be merged.

## Provide a contribution

To make a contribution you should submit a pull request. There will probably be discussion about the pull request and,
if any changes are needed, we would love to work with you to get your pull request merged.
